        <h2 class="left">Website Icons</h2>
        <p>
          All the website icons in the mockups are SVGs, downloaded from
          <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/home" target="_blank">flaticon</a>.
          This type of format allows transparency, same as PNG, in a vector
          form. This means it can be scaled without losing resolution. Also, SVG
          files are normally smaller than PNG, which is great when designing for
          web, as the loading time of pages is a thing to consider.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the webpage itself I've opted to go with
          <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/" target="_blank"
            >font awesome</a
          >. TThis is a SVG file library that is inserted on the website as
          font, allowing easy customisations of the icons with CSS. This is a
          better option if you don't want to spend too much time designing the
          icons and still want some consistency, and has the advantage of not
          having to edit the SVG file directly, as this can be done through CSS.
        </p>

            introduction of TPWARS to the public.

              >shutterstock</a
            >. The manipulation on this image was the text using the text tool.
            Changing the colour of the bag to orange, using the brush tool to
            match the TPWARS branding and to give more colour to the image.
            Using a gradient layer on the left hand side of the image to make
            the text easier to read, and using the clone tool I have removed a
            cucumber that was in the way of the text in the image. The original
            image can be found here. Original dimensions were 5504 x 3670px and
            the image size was 13.7MB.<br />After finishing the image
            manipulation, the dimensions of a saved file were 1000x667px. As
            this is an image for web, there is no need for a file to be as large
            as it was originally. The chosen file type was JPG. This is a lossy
            compression format, meaning the image loses quality each time it's
            saved. For that reason I have maintained the original PSD file, in
            case future changes are needed. Also JPG files are smaller than PNG
            files, and in this case I didn't need to use PNG as the image didn't
            have a transparent background. The image was also saved as a
            progressive image, to allow the image to load fully on the website
            with little detail and allow details to increase once the image is
            fully loaded. This is opposite to the optimised image option that
            loads slower, but in its full quality.

            manipulation here was rotating the image, so the nuts part of the
            image would be on the left hand side. I did this by going to the
            image menu, and using the sub menu rotation. After this, I've added
            the logo, and aligned the main part of the image with the logo, and
            reduce the overall image size so the nuts wouldn't take so much
            image space. To avoid the blank space left by moving and reducing
            the image, I've selected the white spaces and went to the edit menu,
            selected the submenu fill and chose content aware. Used the clone
            toll for retouching patterns that were obviously repeated. After
            that, using the type tool, wrote the text.<br />Saved the image as a

            This is a promotional email banner that will be inserted on the top

            was downloaded from

              >shutterstock</a
            >. In the illustrator I've created an artboard with the measurements
            of a standard email banner, 600x250px, and changed the colours of
            the characters to match the colours used in the interface. After
            that I've saved the image as a JPG, as there was no transparency.
            I've opted for save as type optimised, as there is text in the
            image, and I wanted to make sure it was as readable as possible.

            their computer they would still be able to resize the logo, change
            the colour, etc, and the logo would maintain the same font. I've
            exported the logo as a PNG-8, as the colours I've used fall within
            its colour palette, allowing me to have a smaller file size than
            PNG-24. PNG file has also the advantage of allowing transparency, so
            people that want to use the logo to overlay over an image and don't
            have Illustrator (or other vector-editing software) can do it
            easily.
